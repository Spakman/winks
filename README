  Usage:
=====================================

It is strongly suggested you place winks somewhere in your
path, as this is required for multiwindow support to function
correctly. Once this is done, it can be run by typing 'winks'.

Optionally, you may pass a url as an argument. Note that
this url must be complete for this to work.

Basic usage (case insensitive):

b = back
f = forward
r = refresh
u = activate url bar
i = clear then activate the url bar

Using 'i' and clearing the url bar also enables you to issue
commands. Commands are prefixed by a colon (:).

Currently accepted commands are:

:quit | :q  = quit winks
:new  | :n  = open a new window*
    *This can optionally be passed a URL

Information:

The url bar can take urls in usual formats, adding http://
as required. If you type search terms into it, it will
search google with them.
